A proposed password-less and hands free payment setup for Paypal.

## How does it work?
The user enters the store. The app on the phone automatically connects to open wifi with a particular matching SSID.
The users' name get appended to the list of available Paypal users in the screen and the counter computer can initiate a payment request by simply enterng the amount.
The Paypal user receives a payment request on the phone and the amount is read out loud. The user can simply shake the phone to authorize the payment and do nothing to cancel the payment.
